# demo-stream-function-queue-stream

This example is based on [Spring Cloud Stream](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/html/) project with functional model approach 
and implements [RabbitMQ Queue Streams](https://www.rabbitmq.com/streams.html)

Spring cloud stream provides only initial implementation. More docs [link](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/blob/main/docs/src/main/asciidoc/rabbit/rabbit_overview.adoc#initial-consumer-support-for-the-rabbitmq-stream-plugin).
